    Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision.
    It requires models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence.
    The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks.
    However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
    This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation.
    We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration.
    Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization.
    We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness.
    This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

    LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration.
    Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors.
    The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failureâ€”once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity.
    To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents.
    Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments.
    To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination.
    Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preservingâ€”and sometimes improvingâ€”task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks).
    These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.

    With the burgeoning growth of online video platforms and the escalating volume of video content, the demand for proficient video understanding tools has intensified markedly.
    Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs).
    The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding.
    We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM.
    Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer.
    Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs.
    Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges.
    Finally, it summarizes the limitations of existing Vid-LLMs and outlines directions for future research.

    Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear.

    Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc.
    Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations.
    Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting.
    MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

    Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images, and maintaining concept consistency.

    We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing 4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.
    MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference.
    Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design.

    Audio source separation is fundamental for machines to understand complex acoustic environments and underpins numerous audio applications.
    Current supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes.
    Inspired by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations.
    We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right configuration.
    Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to guide the denoising process to recover individual sources.
    Without any task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors.
    ZeroSep is compatible with a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing even supervised methods.

    Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision tasks, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern.
    While existing methods focus on improving adversarial robustness through training strategies, we explore a novel perspective: leveraging the inherent computation redundancy in ViTs to enhance adversarial transferability.
    We observe that ViTs contain significant computational redundancy across different layers and attention heads, which can be strategically exploited to generate more transferable adversarial examples.
    Our approach, named Harnessing Redundancy for Transferability (HRT), identifies and utilizes the most influential computation paths in ViTs to craft adversarial examples that are more likely to transfer across different models and architectures.
    Through extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10, we demonstrate that HRT significantly improves adversarial transferability compared to existing methods, achieving up to 15% higher success rates in black-box attacks.
    Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between model architecture and adversarial robustness, opening new directions for both attack and defense strategies.

    The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation.
    This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, issues such as maintaining visual consistency, ensuring stylistic coherence, and addressing ethical considerations continue to pose challenges.

    Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains.
    By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained.
    However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events.
    This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to localize audio-visual events in videos temporally.
    To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations.
    PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation.
    By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities.
    Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.

    Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos.
    Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).
    Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization.
    Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT).
    However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate.
    To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%.
    Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries.
    In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions.
    Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks.
    Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.

    Video saliency prediction aims to identify the regions in a video that attract human attention and gaze, driven by bottom-up features from the video and top-down processes like memory and cognition.
    Among these top-down influences, language plays a crucial role in guiding attention by shaping how visual information is interpreted.
    Existing methods primarily focus on modeling perceptual information while neglecting the reasoning process facilitated by language, where ranking cues are crucial outcomes of this process and practical guidance for saliency prediction.
    In this paper, we propose CaRDiff (Caption, Rank, and generate with Diffusion), a framework that imitates the process by integrating multimodal large language model (MLLM), a grounding module, and a diffusion model, to enhance video saliency prediction.
    Specifically, we introduce a novel prompting method VSOR-CoT (Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought), which utilizes an MLLM with a grounding module to caption video content and infer salient objects along with their rankings and positions.
    This process derives ranking maps that can be sufficiently leveraged by the diffusion model to decode the saliency maps for the given video accurately.
    Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of VSOR-CoT in improving the performance of video saliency prediction.
    The proposed CaRDiff performs better than state-of-the-art models on the MVS dataset and demonstrates cross-dataset capabilities on the DHF1k dataset through zero-shot evaluation.

    Diffusion models offer impressive controllability for image tasks, primarily through noise predictions that encode task-specific information and classifier-free guidance enabling adjustable scaling.
    This scaling mechanism implicitly defines a ``scaling space'' whose potential for fine-grained semantic manipulation remains underexplored.
    We investigate this space, starting with inversion-based editing where the difference between conditional/unconditional noise predictions carries key semantic information.
    Our core contribution stems from a Fourier analysis of noise predictions, revealing that its low- and high-frequency components evolve differently throughout diffusion.
    Based on this insight, we introduce FreSca, a straightforward method that applies guidance scaling independently to different frequency bands in the Fourier domain.
    FreSca demonstrably enhances existing image editing methods without retraining. Excitingly, its effectiveness extends to image understanding tasks such as depth estimation, yielding quantitative gains across multiple datasets.

  abstract={
    Text-to-video generation has been dominated by diffusion-based or autoregressive models.
    These novel models provide plausible versatility, but are criticized for improper physical motion, shading and illumination, camera motion, and temporal consistency.
    The film industry relies on manually-edited Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) using 3D modeling software.
    Human-directed 3D synthetic videos address these shortcomings, but require tight collaboration between movie makers and 3D rendering experts.
    We introduce an automatic synthetic video generation pipeline based on Vision Large Language Model (VLM) agent collaborations.
    Given a language description of a video, multiple VLM agents direct various processes of the generation pipeline.
    They cooperate to create Blender scripts which render a video following the given description. Augmented with Blender-based movie making knowledge, the Director agent decomposes the text-based video description into sub-processes.
    For each sub-process, the Programmer agent produces Python-based Blender scripts based on function composing and API calling.
    The Reviewer agent, with knowledge of video reviewing, character motion coordinates, and intermediate screenshots, provides feedback to the Programmer agent.
    The Programmer agent iteratively improves scripts to yield the best video outcome.
    Our generated videos show better quality than commercial video generation models in five metrics on video quality and instruction-following performance.
    Our framework outperforms other approaches in a user study on quality, consistency, and rationality.

    Existing methods like Neural Radiation Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant strides in facial attribute control such as facial animation and components editing, yet they struggle with fine-grained representation and scalability in dynamic head modeling.
    To address these limitations, we propose GaussianStyle, a novel framework that integrates the volumetric strengths of 3DGS with the powerful implicit representation of StyleGAN.
    The GaussianStyle preserves structural information, such as expressions and poses, using Gaussian points, while projecting the implicit volumetric representation into StyleGAN to capture high-frequency details and mitigate the over-smoothing commonly observed in neural texture rendering.
    Experimental outcomes indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reenactment, novel view synthesis, and animation.

    We present CAT-V (Caption AnyThing in Video), a training-free framework for fine-grained object-centric video captioning that enables detailed descriptions of user-selected objects through time.
    CAT-V integrates three key components: a Segmenter based on SAMURAI for precise object segmentation across frames, a Temporal Analyzer powered by TRACE-Uni for accurate event boundary detection and temporal analysis, and a Captioner using InternVL-2.5 for generating detailed object-centric descriptions.
    Through spatiotemporal visual prompts and chain-of-thought reasoning, our framework generates detailed, temporally-aware descriptions of objects' attributes, actions, statuses, interactions, and environmental contexts without requiring additional training data.
    CAT-V supports flexible user interactions through various visual prompts (points, bounding boxes, and irregular regions) and maintains temporal sensitivity by tracking object states and interactions across different time segments.
    Our approach addresses limitations of existing video captioning methods, which either produce overly abstract descriptions or lack object-level precision, enabling fine-grained, object-specific descriptions while maintaining temporal coherence and spatial accuracy.

    Reasoning is central to human intelligence, enabling structured problem-solving across diverse tasks.
    Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their reasoning abilities in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains.
    However, effectively extending these capabilities into multimodal contexts-where models must integrate both visual and textual inputs-continues to be a significant challenge.
    Multimodal reasoning introduces complexities, such as handling conflicting information across modalities, which require models to adopt advanced interpretative strategies.
    Addressing these challenges involves not only sophisticated algorithms but also robust methodologies for evaluating reasoning accuracy and coherence.
    This paper offers a concise yet insightful overview of reasoning techniques in both textual and multimodal LLMs.
    Through a thorough and up-to-date comparison, we clearly formulate core reasoning challenges and opportunities, highlighting practical methods for post-training optimization and test-time inference.
    Our work provides valuable insights and guidance, bridging theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, and sets clear directions for future research.

    Visual reasoning is central to human cognition, enabling individuals to interpret and abstractly understand their environment.
    Although recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks primarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual reasoning capabilities.
    To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a benchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs.
    VERIFY compels models to reason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases.
    Each problem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first to provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes.
    Additionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity beyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model reasoning patterns.
    Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers significant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic approach to both perception and reasoning.

    In response, we introduce the EAGLE (Egocentric AGgregated Language-video Engine) model and the EAGLE-400K dataset to provide a unified framework that integrates various egocentric video understanding tasks. 
    EAGLE-400K, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for egocentric video, features 400K diverse samples to enhance a broad spectrum task from activity recognition to procedure knowledge learning.
    Moreover, EAGLE, a strong video-based multimodal large language model (MLLM), is designed to effectively capture both spatial and temporal information.
    In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics designed to facilitate a thorough assessment of MLLM for egocentric video understanding.
    Our extensive experiments demonstrate EAGLE's superior performance over existing models, highlighting its ability to balance task-specific understanding with comprehensive video interpretation.

  abstract={
    The advent of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, enabling more sophisticated and accurate integration of visual and textual information across various tasks, including image and video captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval.
    Despite VLMs' superior capabilities, researchers lack a comprehensive understanding of their compositionality -- the ability to understand and produce novel combinations of known visual and textual components.
    Prior benchmarks provide only a relatively rough compositionality evaluation from the perspectives of objects, relations, and attributes while neglecting deeper reasoning about object interactions, counting, and complex compositions.
    However, compositionality is a critical ability that facilitates coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities for VLMs.
    To address this limitation, we propose MMCOMPOSITION, a novel human-annotated benchmark for comprehensively and accurately evaluating VLMs' compositionality.
    Our proposed benchmark serves as a complement to these earlier works.
    With MMCOMPOSITION, we can quantify and explore the compositionality of the mainstream VLMs.
    Surprisingly, we find GPT-4o's compositionality inferior to the best open-source model, and we analyze the underlying reasons.
    Our experimental analysis reveals the limitations of VLMs in fine-grained compositional perception and reasoning, and points to areas for improvement in VLM design and training.

  abstract={
    Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in integrating visual and linguistic contexts to produce detailed content, facilitating applications such as image captioning.
    However, using LVLMs to generate descriptions often faces the challenge of object hallucination (OH), where the output text misrepresents actual objects in the input image.
    While previous studies attribute the occurrence of OH to the inclusion of more details, our study finds technical flaws in existing metrics, leading to unreliable evaluations of models and conclusions about OH.
    This has sparked a debate on the question: Do more details always introduce more hallucinations in LVLM-based image captioning?
    In this paper, we address this debate by proposing a novel decoding strategy, Differentiated Beam Decoding (DBD), along with a reliable new set of evaluation metrics: CLIP-Precision, CLIP-Recall, and CLIP-F1. DBD decodes the wealth of information hidden in visual input into distinct language representations called unit facts in parallel.
    This decoding is achieved via a well-designed differential score that guides the parallel search and candidate screening.
    The selected unit facts are then aggregated to generate the final caption. Our proposed metrics evaluate the comprehensiveness and accuracy of image captions by comparing the embedding groups of ground-truth image regions and generated text partitions.
    Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that it produces detailed descriptions while maintaining low hallucination levels.

    Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks by producing high-fidelity content from text descriptions.
    They have also enabled an editing paradigm where concepts can be replaced through text conditioning (e.g., a dog to a tiger).
    In this work, we explore a novel approach: instead of replacing a concept, can we enhance or suppress the concept itself?
    Through an empirical study, we identify a trend where concepts can be decomposed in text-guided diffusion models.
    Leveraging this insight, we introduce ScalingConcept, a simple yet effective method to scale decomposed concepts up or down in real input without introducing new elements.
    To systematically evaluate our approach, we present the WeakConcept-10 dataset, where concepts are imperfect and need to be enhanced.
    More importantly, ScalingConcept enables a variety of novel zero-shot applications across image and audio domains, including tasks such as canonical pose generation and generative sound highlighting or removal.

      Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videos into shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial information conveyed by advertisers.

      The existing method performs well at video segmentation stages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome models and poor performance at the segment assemblage stage.
      To address these problems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which can perform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end.
      It utilizes multi-modal representation extracted from the segments and follows the Encoder-Decoder Ptr-Net framework with the Attention mechanism.
      Importance-coherence reward is designed for training M-SAN.
      We experiment on the Ads-1k dataset with 1000+ videos under rich ad scenarios collected from advertisers.
      To evaluate the methods, we propose a unified metric, Imp-Coh@Time, which comprehensively assesses the importance, coherence, and duration of the outputs at the same time.
      Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than random selection and the previous method on the metric. Ablation experiments further verify that multi-modal representation and importance-coherence reward significantly improve the performance.
