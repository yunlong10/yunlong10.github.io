1. I wish to collaborate and communicate as equal co-authors, with each party contributing to the best of their abilities. The author list will be arranged according to the level of contribution.
2. I do not prefer to mentor others. If you are seeking collaboration, please ensure you already possess some project experience.
3. I recommend scheduling the start of our collaboration at the beginning of an academic term or holiday period, rather than initiating projects at other times.
4. Please avoid assuming the role of a mentor, regardless of how senior you may be. I only consider two types of individuals as my mentors: (1) those who recruit me into their company for internship projects, or (2) my undergraduate/PhD academic advisors.
5. If you wish to become my mentor outside of these two scenarios, you should provide sufficient and directly accessible computational resources as well as reasonable compensation (I do not accept unpaid work; however, considering U.S. legal restrictions on income for F1 students, financial compensation is not recommended), while allowing me to work independently without unnecessary interference and maintaining mutual respect. Under these conditions, I would accept a mentor-mentee relationship.
6. Without my explicit consent, do not list me as your mentee on your resume, personal webpage, academic papers, or any other platform.
7. If you are placed toward the end of the author list (even if you requested this arrangement), this only reflects your contribution level or that you don't care about author ordering, and does not indicate that I consider you as my mentor (with the exception of my academic advisor).
8. If you find all the above acceptable, please feel free to [contact me](/#social-links)!
