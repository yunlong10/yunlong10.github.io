title: "Collaboration Precautions"
description: ""
---

1. I wish to collaborate and communicate as equal co-authors, with each party contributing to the best of their abilities. The author list will be arranged according to the level of contribution.
2. I do not prefer to mentor others. If you are seeking collaboration, please ensure you already possess some project experience.
3. I recommend scheduling the start of our collaboration at the beginning of an academic term or holiday period, rather than initiating projects at other times.
4. Please avoid assuming the role of a mentor, regardless of how senior you may be. I only consider two types of individuals as my mentors: (1) those who recruit me into their company for internship projects, or (2) my undergraduate/PhD academic advisors.
5. If you wish to become my mentor outside of these two scenarios, you should provide sufficient and directly accessible computational resources as well as reasonable compensation (I do not accept unpaid work; however, considering U.S. legal restrictions on income for F1 students, financial compensation is not recommended), while allowing me to work independently without unnecessary interference and maintaining mutual respect. Under these conditions, I would accept a mentor-mentee relationship.
6. Without my explicit consent, do not list me as your mentee on your resume, personal webpage, academic papers, or any other platform.
7. If you are placed toward the end of the author list (even if you requested this arrangement), this only reflects your contribution level or that you don't care about author ordering, and does not indicate that I consider you as my mentor (with the exception of my academic advisor).
8. If you find all the above acceptable, please feel free to [contact me](/#social-links)!

## 合作注意事项

1. 希望能以平等的co-author身份进行合作和交流，各方尽自己所能贡献，作者顺序根据贡献排列。
2. 本人不倾向于指导他人，若寻求合作，请确保您已具备一定的项目经验。
3. 建议将合作开始时间安排在学期初或假期开始，以确保有充足时间进行项目开展，避免在其他时间点启动新项目。
4. 请避免主动以mentor身份自居，不论您有多senior。本人的mentor仅限于以下两种情况：(1) 将本人招募进公司进行实习项目的负责人，(2) 本人的本科/博士阶段的academic advisor。
5. 若希望在上述两种情况之外成为本人mentor，需提供充足且可直接访问的计算资源支持以及合理的报酬（本人不接受无偿劳动，但考虑到美国F1学生身份对收入的法律限制，不建议经济方面的报酬），并在项目中给予足够的自主空间，避免不必要的干涉，彼此尊重。在此情况下，本人会考虑接受此mentor-mentee关系。
6. 未经本人明确同意，请避免在简历、个人主页、学术论文或任何其他场合将本人列为您的mentee。
7. 如果您在author list中被放到了靠最后的位置（即使是您主动要求的），这只能反映您的贡献程度或者您不care作者顺序，并不表示本人将您视为mentor（本人的academic advisor除外）。
8. 如果对于以上都没问题，please feel free to [contact me](/#social-links)!
