I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/index.html).

I obtained my B.Eng. from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PcmyXHMAAAAJ).
I've interned at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/), [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), and [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/).

My recent research focuses on **multimodal learning**, particularly **LLMs/VLMs for video understanding**. I am also exploring video agents, generation, and computational arts.
